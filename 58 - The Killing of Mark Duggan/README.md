This folder contains a collection of 3D models used in the Mark Duggan investigation.

| File Name | Contents |
|---|---|
| MD_Main Animation.blend | The event model, showing the hard stop and variations of Mark Duggan throwing the gun at different moments. |
| MD_Site Context.blend | The buildings and streetscape in the surrounding area. |
| MD_Mark Duggan Body.blend | The body of Mark Duggan including shot lines and bullet entry and exit wounds. |
| MD_CO19 Officers.blend | The bodies of the CO19 firearms officers. |

In order to open these files you will need to download [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/).  You will need to download all the files into the same folder to use the Main Animation file.

## Main Animation

This file contains what is referred to as the 'event model'.  It contains models of the site context, vehicles and characters, all of which were present at the moment of the hard stop.  The models are articulated with armatures and animated to reflect the reconstruction of the movements of the CO19 officers and Mark Duggan as determined by Forensic Architecture.

The 3D model can be browsed using 'collections' in the [Blender outliner](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/view_layers/introduction.html#outliner).

The collection 'Actors' contains 3D models of all persons that were present at the moment of the hard stop.  

The collection 'Mark Duggan' contains collections representing the 5 scenarios for the movement of the gun from the minicab to the grass including:

| Scenario no. | Event |
|---|---|
|0| Mark Duggan exiting the minicab without a gun.|
|1| Mark Duggan throwing the gun before exiting the minicab.|
|2| Mark Duggan throwing the gun before the first shot.|  
|3| Mark Duggan throwing the gun after the first shot.|
|4| Mark Duggan throwing the gun after the second shot.|

These can be toggled by pressing the checkbox next to the colection in the outliner.

The collection 'Vehicles' contains models of all of the vehicles that were involved in the hard stop.

The collection 'Site Context' contains the static elements of the surrounding streetscape and buildings and pulls data from the file MD_Site Context.blend.

The collection 'Lighting' contains a sunlight which is positioned as it would have been on the day and at the time of the hard stop.

The collection 'Cameras' contains all of the camera motions that were used to make the film produced by Forensic Architecture.

The collection 'Annotation' contains lines and markings which help to illustrate features of the 3D model.  This includes the footsteps as described by Professor Derrick Pounder and the areas in which it is most likely that V53 and W42 stood.

The collection 'Probes' contains elements which are used to calculate reflections in wing mirrors and rear view mirrors.

The collection 'Ornaments' contains null objects which are used to control the positions of the limbs of the characters in the scene.
